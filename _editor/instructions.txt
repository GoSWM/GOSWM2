Pages that do not contain editing blocks can be edited from the open body tag to the close body tag by Type1, Type3, & Type5 users.

Type2, Type4 & Type6 users can edit only inside of editing blocks

Review the source code of test.html to see how to set up editblocks and the login prompt on your pages
Below are examples of how to setup block editing on html pages.

 Editblocks must be coded into pages to edit only parts of pages. Example:

<DIV class="editblock-1">
Content to edit
</DIV><!--"editblock-1" -->

If you have multiple users editing a page you can specify which users can edit particular blocks by using a userblock instead of an editblock. Example:

<DIV class="userblock-mike,cindy">
Content that users mike and cindy can edit
</DIV><!--"userblock-mike,cindy" -->

Alternately, sections of pages can be protected from editing by using excludeblocks. Example:

<DIV class="excludeblock-1">
Content to exclude from editing
</DIV><!--"excludeblock-1" -->

You can even write an edit on a page to an included file (SSI, PHP, ASP) using an includeblock. Example:

<DIV class="includeblock-/nav.shtml">
<!--#include virtual="/nav.shtml" -->
</DIV>

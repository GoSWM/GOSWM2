#INTROPAGE
text1=This tool will create a process that allows new users to automatically add themselves to the editor list of users and create a personal WebSpace within your WebSite.  There are two types of processes:
text2=<b>Process Without A Payment Interval.</b> This process requires <b>one page</b> for a form.
text3=This is a single step process. The visitor simply completes a form requesting their desired username, a password and their email address. The process then checks for the availability of the username and creates a new $brand user account for the visitor. The new user inherits a predetermined user setup. The process also creates a folder for the new user using the username and populates that folder with a predetermined set of files and folders.
text4=<b>Process With A Payment Interval.</b> This process requires <b>three pages</b> for forms and an account with a payment processor (Example: PayPal)
text5=<b>Step One:</b> The visitor submits only their desired username. This step verifies the availability of the username and sets an encrypted cookie containing the username. This step redirects to Step Two.
text6=<b>Step Two:</b> The visitor processes a payment transaction. This page needs to contain a form prepared for the payment processor.  Click <span style="cursor:hand;color:blue" onclick=tutorial()>HERE </span>for a Flash tutorial on setting up PayPal Recurring Payments for this Step.
text7=<b>Step Three:</b> When the visitor returns from the payment process this page requests them to submit a password to use. This submission will read the cookie set in Step One to verify that this is the username that just paid (preventing the setting up of multiple accounts with one payment), and then create a new $brand user account for the visitor. The new user will inherit a predetermined user setup. The process also creates a folder for the new user using the username and populates that folder with a predetermined set of files and folders.
